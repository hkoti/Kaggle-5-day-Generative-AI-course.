    "Welcome back to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course. In this notebook, you'll learn some techniques for evaluating the output of a language model. As part of the evaluation, you will also use Gemini's structured data capability to produce evaluation results as instances of Python types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This notebook is more code-heavy than the first Day 1 notebook ([Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/)). This notebook is not a prerequisite for days 2 and beyond, so feel free to skip over it, or come back later in the week. If you have not yet tried the [Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/) notebook, start there first as it introduces the fundamentals for interacting with LLMs.\n",

       "**Key Aspects of the Training Process:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Model Architecture:**\n",
       "    *   Gemini 1.5 Pro is a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer-based model.\n",
       "    *   It builds upon the research advances of Gemini 1.0 and a longer history of MoE research at Google.\n",
       "    *   MoE models use a learned routing function to direct inputs to a subset of the model's parameters for processing. This allows for a larger total parameter count while keeping the number of activated parameters constant.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Training Infrastructure:**\n",
       "    *   Trained on multiple 4096-chip pods of Google's TPUv4 accelerators.\n",
       "    *   The training is distributed across multiple datacenters.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Training Data:**\n",
       "    *   A variety of multimodal and multilingual data is used.\n",
       "    *   The pre-training dataset includes data sourced from various domains, including web documents, code, images, audio, and video content.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Instruction Tuning:**\n",
       "    *   Gemini 1.5 Pro is fine-tuned on a collection of multimodal data containing paired instructions and appropriate responses.\n",
       "    *   Further tuning is based on human preference data.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Long-Context Understanding:**\n",
       "    *   The model incorporates significant architecture changes to enable long-context understanding of inputs up to 10 million tokens without degrading performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "6.  **Safety Mitigations:**\n",
       "    *   Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF) are used to mitigate safety risks.\n",
       "    *   The safety mitigation is focused on adversarial or \"harm-inducing\" queries.\n",

       "However, based on the provided document, here's a summary of the key points about Gemini 1.5 Pro and its position relative to other models:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Gemini 1.5 Pro:** This is the latest model from the Gemini family, developed by Google DeepMind. It's a multimodal mixture-of-experts model.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Key Features of Gemini 1.5 Pro:**\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   **Long Context:** It excels at recalling and reasoning over fine-grained information from millions of tokens of context (up to 10M tokens and beyond). This is a significant leap compared to models like Claude 2.1 (200k) and GPT-4 Turbo (128k).\n",
       "    *   **Multimodal:** It can handle various input modalities, including text, video, and audio.\n",
       "    *   **Efficiency:** It achieves performance comparable to Gemini 1.0 Ultra (a state-of-the-art model) while requiring significantly less compute to train.\n",
       "    *   **In-Context Learning:** It demonstrates surprising new capabilities, such as learning to translate a new language (Kalamang) from a single set of linguistic documentation.\n",
       "    *   **Strong Performance:** It achieves near-perfect recall on long-context retrieval tasks, improves state-of-the-art in long-document QA, long-video QA, and long-context ASR, and matches or surpasses Gemini 1.0 Ultra's performance across a broad set of benchmarks.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Gemini 1.5 Pro vs. Other Models:**\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   **Gemini 1.0 Pro:** Gemini 1.5 Pro generally outperforms Gemini 1.0 Pro across a wide range of benchmarks.\n",
       "    *   **Gemini 1.0 Ultra:** Gemini 1.5 Pro performs better than Gemini 1.0 Ultra on more than half of the benchmarks, despite using less training compute.\n",
       "    *   **Claude 2.1:** Gemini 1.5 Pro significantly surpasses Claude 2.1 in long-context recall.\n",
       "    *   **GPT-4 Turbo:** Gemini 1.5 Pro demonstrates superior long-context capabilities compared to GPT-4 Turbo.\n",
       "    *   **GPT-4V:** Gemini 1.5 Pro outperforms GPT-4V on video-related tasks, especially with longer video inputs.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Limitations and Considerations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   The document is a technical report from Google DeepMind, so it presents a favorable view of Gemini 1.5 Pro.\n",
       "    *   The \"best\" model depends on the specific task. While Gemini 1.5 Pro excels in long-context scenarios, other models might be more suitable for tasks with shorter context requirements.\n",
       "    *   The document acknowledges that the choice of prompting method and type of needle affect final performance of models, and future versions of “needle(s)-in-a-haystack\" style tests should account for prompt robustness.\n",
       "    *   The document acknowledges that the model struggles to understand when to discuss contextually relevant information.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In conclusion:**\n",
       "\n",
       "If your primary need is for a model that can process and reason over extremely long contexts (millions of tokens) and handle multiple modalities, Gemini 1.5 Pro appears to be a leading contender based on this document. However, it's essential to consider your specific use case, evaluate other models, and be aware of the potential limitations.\n",

       "    *   The Transformer uses a mechanism called \"attention\" to focus on the most relevant parts of the input when making decisions. Think of it as selectively reinforcing certain areas of the foundation based on the load they're carrying.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) (The Load-Bearing Walls):**\n",
       "    *   This is where Gemini 1.5 Pro gets its efficiency and scalability. Instead of having one giant neural network, it uses a \"mixture of experts.\"\n",
       "    *   Imagine a building with different specialized teams (experts) for different tasks (e.g., one team for text analysis, another for image recognition, another for audio processing).\n",
       "    *   A \"routing function\" acts like a project manager, deciding which expert team is best suited to handle a particular piece of the input data. This is like assigning the right crew to the right task on a construction site.\n",
       "    *   The key benefit is that not all the \"experts\" are active at the same time. This significantly reduces the computational cost, allowing the model to be much larger and handle more complex tasks without requiring excessive resources.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Multimodal Input Processing (The Utility Connections):**\n",
       "    *   Gemini 1.5 Pro is designed to handle multiple types of data (text, images, audio, video) simultaneously.\n",
       "    *   Think of this as the utility connections (electricity, water, data) coming into the building. Each type of data is processed by specialized modules that convert it into a common format that the Transformer can understand.\n",
       "    *   This allows the model to understand the relationships between different modalities. For example, it can understand that a caption describes an image or that a sound effect is associated with a particular scene in a video.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Long Context Window (The Span of the Structure):**\n",
       "    *   This is a key innovation of Gemini 1.5 Pro. It can process extremely long sequences of data (millions of \"tokens,\" which are essentially words or parts of words).\n",
       "    *   Think of this as the overall span of a bridge or the length of a tunnel. The longer the span, the more complex the engineering challenges.\n",
       "    *   The long context window allows the model to understand the overall structure and meaning of very large inputs, such as entire books, hours of video, or large codebases.\n",
       "\n",
       "**How It Works (The Construction Process):**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Input:** The model receives input data (text, image, audio, video, or a combination).\n",
       "2.  **Modality Processing:** Each modality is processed by its respective module to convert it into a suitable format.\n",
       "3.  **Routing:** The routing function decides which \"experts\" are best suited to handle the input.\n",
       "4.  **Processing:** The selected experts process the input data using the Transformer architecture.\n",
       "5.  **Output:** The model generates an output based on its understanding of the input.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Advantages (The Benefits of the Design):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Efficiency:** The MoE architecture allows the model to be very large and powerful without requiring excessive computational resources.\n",
       "*   **Scalability:** The model can handle extremely long sequences of data.\n",
       "*   **Multimodality:** The model can understand and reason about information from various sources.\n",
       "*   **Generalization:** The model can perform a wide range of tasks, from answering questions to translating languages.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In Summary:**\n",
       "\n",
       "Gemini 1.5 Pro is a sophisticated system that combines the power of the Transformer architecture with the efficiency of a mixture-of-experts approach. Its ability to handle multimodal input and extremely long sequences of data makes it a powerful tool for understanding and processing complex information. Think of it as a well-designed and efficiently constructed infrastructure project that can handle a wide range of demands.\n",

    "\n",
    "### LLM limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are known to have problems on certain tasks, and these challenges still persist when using LLMs as evaluators. For example, LLMs can struggle to count the number of characters in a word (this is a numerical problem, not a language problem), so an LLM evaluator will not be able to accurately evaluate this type of task. There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customising evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on \"internal knowledge\" from the model, or behaviour that might be better provided from a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve the confidence of your evaluations is to include a diverse set of evaluators. That is, use the same prompts and outputs, but execute them on different models, like Gemini Flash and Pro, or even across different providers, like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT and local models like Gemma or Qwen. This follows the same idea used earlier, where repeating trials to gather multiple \"opinions\" helps to [reduce error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), except by using different models the \"opinions\" will be more diverse.\n",
